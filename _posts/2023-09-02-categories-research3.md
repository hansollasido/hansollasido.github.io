## AMBA란?

AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture)

- A set of open-standard protocols introduced by ARM Ltd. for designing high-performance, on-chip communication systems. 
- AMBA is widely used in SoCs designs for the interconnection and management of functional blocks within the chip, such as CPUs, memory blocks, DMA controllers, and I/O interfaces.

1. AHB (AMBA High-performance Bus)
- It typically interconnects processors, level-one or level-two cache memories, and other high-speed components.
2. ASB (AMBA System Bus)
- Older than AHB. ASB was targeted at the interface between processors and the peripheral interfaces. It's not as common in newer designs.
3. APB (AMBA Peripheral Bus)
- Designed for low-cost, low-bandwidth peripherals.
4. AXI (AMBA eXtensible Interface)
5. ACE (AMBA Coherency Extension)
6. CHI (Coherent Hub Interface)

-> 김정래 교수님 강의자료 다시 읽어봐야 할듯. 거기에 잘 설명되어 있음.
